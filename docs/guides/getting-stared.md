# Get Melting

It all starts with your master conf,that's the applications definitions of what
configurations are available, their name, their type.

From now on, all additional configuration will fallback to the master values if
not set.

From there, you  tell melt what else to expect: user configs, env vars,
command-line options, directory dotfiles and so forth.
